# Music-Dates
Gets release dates for songs from a .txt file using Spotify API and saves it as a songs.txt file.

# How To
1) Install necessary dependencies: spotipy
2) Replace "YOUR-CLIENT_ID-HERE" and "YOUR-CLIENT_SECRET-HERE" with yout own Spotify API keys
3) This is programmed to read a .txt file using the following format ONLY: Song - Artist ex: We are young - Fun
4) Run
5) Enjoy?

# Why?
We were tasked to get the release years for over 200 songs for a mussic class.
Instead of doing it manually I created a script that does it for me.
